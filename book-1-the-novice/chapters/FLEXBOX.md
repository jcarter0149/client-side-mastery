# Using Flexbox for Page Layout

## Learning the Basics with Flexbox Froggy

Visit [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and go through the guided tutorial to learn the basics of page layout with Flexbox.

## Practice: Coffee Houses of Nashville

> The learning objective for this practice exercise is to use `display:flex` on two elements, and then add additional CSS properties to achieve a desired layout.

```html
<header class="pageHeader">Coffee Houses of Nashville</header>

<article class="list">
  <section class="shop">The Jam</section>
  <section class="shop">The Well</section>
  <section class="shop">Red Bicycle</section>
  <section class="shop">Crema</section>
  <section class="shop">Frothy Monkey</section>
  <section class="shop">8th &amp; Roast</section>
  <section class="shop">Bongo Java</section>
  <section class="shop">Flatrock</section>
  <section class="shop">Fido</section>
  <section class="shop">Steadfast Coffee</section>
  <section class="shop">Dose Coffee</section>
  <section class="shop">Sam &amp; Zoes</section>
  <section class="shop">Slow Hand Coffee</section>
  <section class="shop">The Horn</section>
</article>
```

From that HTML, use Flexbox to achieve this layout. You don't need to add the border. It's been added in this example to highlight the alignment and spacing you're shooting for.

## UI/UX Challenge
**This is an optional challenge once you meet MVP. Make a new Github branch for this challenge.**

Creating visual hierarchies
1. Add an address, phone number, and website link to each coffee house (you may use mocked data)
2. Using semantic HTML and CSS, style each coffee house component with the goals of easy scannability. At a minimum, you will emphasize the name of each shop and make the website link clearly clickable.

Background color - if you add a background color/image, ensure the copy (text color) has good contrast and is legible.
