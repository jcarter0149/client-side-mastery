# Updating LinkedIn

LinkedIn has a feature that allows you to capture information about projects that you complete during your career.

Follow the [instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/43524/adding-and-editing-projects-on-your-profile?lang=en) for adding your Celebrity Tribute group project to your profile. It should contain the following information.

* Name of project
* The date you started the group project
* The date you ended the group project
* The description field should list the purpose of the project, the list of technologies you used, and a personal anecdote about what you learned during the project.

#### Example Description

I built a project with 3 teammates that was a tribute to Engleburt Humperdink. This was our first group project at Nashville Software School, and we used HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Visual Studio Code, Git, Github, and `http-server` to build the website.

The most important lesson I learned during this group project was how important it is to think about what you are going to do before you do it. I also learned how git and Github can help a team work on a project together effectively.
